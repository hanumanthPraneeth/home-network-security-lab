# Home Network Security Hardening \& Threat Analysis Lab

This project simulates a small network environment using virtual machines and pfSense firewall to model real-world security challenges.
It focuses on system hardening, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and remediation planning.



This project was completed as part of my transition from technical support to cybersecurity. It demonstrates my ability to set up and secure a virtualized home lab, conduct vulnerability assessments, perform ethical hacking, and implement remediations.



## Lab Duration

üóìÔ∏è March ‚Äì May 2025 (3 months)

## Lab Highlights

* Built a virtual lab using pfSense, Kali, Ubuntu, and Windows 10
* Hardened Linux and Windows systems (firewalls, SSH, patching)
* Scanned with Nmap and OpenVAS to identify vulnerabilities
* Performed exploits using Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap, and Hydra
* Applied remediation strategies and configured basic logging (Syslog)

## Tools \& Tech Stack

Kali, Ubuntu, Windows 10, pfSense, Nmap, OpenVAS, Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap, Hydra, Syslog
